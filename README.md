LEGO:registered: Racers 2 Alternate Installer
=============================================

An alternate installer for _LEGOÂ® Racers 2_, written using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
to replace the original 16-bit InstallShield installer. It can be used to work around the "Not enough memory" bug of the original installer.

This project uses code from [bgbennyboy](https://github.com/bgbennyboy)'s [_Grim Fandango Setup_](https://github.com/bgbennyboy/Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher)
to pull the files off the disc, modified by Triangle717 to support ANSI and Unicode Inno Setup.
